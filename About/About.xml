[h1]Description[/h1]
Small mod that makes traders prefer some goods over other: every item has random price multiplier in range 0.6-1.4 (configurable).
The mod also has advanced mode, that allows to change how bargain price are calculated.

[h2]Changelog[/h2]
- Added a modifier of balance instead of just choosing selling price from minimum between buying and selling prices as vanilla does. It depends on difference between buying and selling price modifiers to ensure that a pawn with lower negotiator (social and shit) skill would not sell an item for higher price than another pawn with higher negotiator skill would. The lower the difference the higher the chance to see its effect.
- Fixed "trader type price", "trader demand modifier" now depends on it: the higher trader type modifier the lower trader demand modifier effect (configurable).

Mod idea: Kori

Should be compatible with other mods, that don't change trading screen. Does not require new save and can be safely deleted from existing.
